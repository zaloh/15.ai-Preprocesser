# Voice Data 15.ai Preprocesser

This is a simple voice preprocessing solution designed to smooth out the workflow for importing vocal datasets into 15.ai

## Preparation

In order continue we will need to independently acquire a WAV file recording of various lines, and an accompanying SRT caption file from that clip. 

## Instructions

For the purposes of this project, I have been testing by downloading videos and captions from Youtube's automatic captioning system. 

>For the WAV File: https://ontiva.com/en  
>For the SRT Captioning File: https://downsub.com/

To finish off, we will need to input the audio and captioning file into the GUI of Voiceparser to process them into a more digestible dataset for language processing. These can then be cleaned up in Notepad and Audacity.
